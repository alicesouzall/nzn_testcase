## About the test case
- This project was developed with Javascript and NodeJS.
- This project was developed according to the principles of TDD, using the Jest library to run the tests.
- Note: although the standard practice is to delete branches after they have been merged, I have kept the branches to demonstrate that the project was developed following Git flow and conventional commits principles.
